1. After unzipping "Project1_skidmore", open up "Project1.cpp" using your preferred C++ IDE or terminal.
2. Compile (run) the file "Project1.cpp".

4. "Project1_skidmore" contains the four test cases provided: 
	test_case1.obj
	test_case2.obj
	test_case3.obj
	test_case4.obj
Enter one of these into the command window, or upload your own text file into the Project 1 folder and type in that file name exactly
5. Check the proj1_skidmore.asm for the instructions.
